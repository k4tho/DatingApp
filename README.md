# dating_app_simulation

This program simulates a dating app like tinder or hinge. A user can create a profile where they would include information like name, age, and gender. They will also select what gender they're looking for. The program will then pull up profiles that fit the gender preference. The user will be able to look at their profile display and swipe right or left on them. After swiping on all of their potentials, they will be able to see their matches, liked and disliked profiles.
